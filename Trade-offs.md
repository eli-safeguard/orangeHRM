Trade-offs

In the interest of time, only core functionalities were tested, and tests were written directly in spec files.

Given more time, I would have included:
1. More tests - increase test coverage to include filter dropdowns, search menus, etc.
2. Better tests - include more data validations, make methods/locators more dynamic, use fixture files to store test data, etc.
3. Implement Cucumber feature files
